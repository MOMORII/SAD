Part 1: Component and Interface Concepts

1- What is a software component? Explain its key characteristics.
A software component is a modular, reusable unit of software with a well-defined interface. Key characteristics include encapsulation, reusability, and independence.

2- Define the term "interface" in the context of software design.
An interface in software design defines a contract specifying methods that a class must implement, promoting abstraction and modularity.

3- How does the Transportable interface demonstrate the principles of modular
design?
The Transportable interface follows modular design principles by defining a clear contract for transport-related behavior, enabling flexibility and code reuse without tightly coupling implementations.
